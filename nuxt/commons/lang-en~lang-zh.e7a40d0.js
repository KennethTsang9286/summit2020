In the context of Hong Kong and Macau, China has attempted to clamp down on civic votes / referendums.  In the past few years, the authorities and state-sponsored actors have abused criminal procedures and launched cyberattacks to interfere with the organisation of these votes in both Hong Kong and Macau.\\n\\nIn the case of the 2019 Vote on Chief Execution Election in Macau, the vote organiser was forced to close the vote prematurely after encountering multifaceted attacks.   The presentation will cover the political threat facing the vote as well as the technical aspect of the defence.  I will discuss the pattern of the Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, whether over-engineering is necessary and the measures I took to mitigate these threats.  Despite the success in defence of the voting application on the technical front, the vote ended up a failure.  Key members of the vote organiser received threats to their personal safety.  Not only did the organiser halt the vote but also cancelled a planned press conference at which the results would be announced.  The lessons learnt from the failure of the 2019 Macau Vote might help others plan a similar vote in the future.
