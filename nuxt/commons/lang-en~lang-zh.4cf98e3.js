By doing so, we wish to associate A. thaliana with internet freedom.

A. thaliana is the most well-known model plant which grows easily at approx. 25͑͒᷾͐°C. The plant appears insignificant and the seeds are smaller than a dot of pencil.

We hence established a biodiversity database that embraces the concept of open data - the Taiwan Biodiversity Network. Such a database aims to invite various sources of data collectors - including citizen scientists, NGOs, academic institutes, government agencies - to engage in different roles in the life cycle of biodiversity open data. We also work with researchers and data analysts to use biodiversity open data to involve in the decision process of emerging conservation issues. In this symposium, we will share our experiences and insights on (1) pathways to engage in biodiversity open data, (2) data application cases such as the conflict between green-energy and wildlife conservation, and (3) current requirement and limitations in using biodiversity open data.","oral_language":"華語","oral_languate_other":"","format":"主題論壇 （60 分鐘）Panel discussion (60 min)","topic":"大島開放 Open island","three_keywords":"生物多樣性、資料庫、政策應用","cover_image":"https://i.imgur.com/8oc9HTIh.jpg","is_content_cc40":true,"is_presentation_cc40":true,"is_slide_cc40":true,"related_url":"https://www.tbn.org.tw/","speakers":[{"display_name":"柯智仁","organization":"特有生物研究保育中心","avatar_url":"https://i.imgur.com/HqQZGGhh.jpg","city":"南投縣集集鎮","info_url":"","bio":"2016年開始在特生中心擔任助理研究員，承接生物多樣性資料庫的計畫：台灣生物多樣性網絡。在很強的同事們和工程師的協助與支持下讓資料量翻了30倍，也改變了臺灣生物多樣性資料的搜尋方式，開心，希望有更多人知道、使用這樣的開放資料。背景領域是聽小鳥唱歌和鳥類研究（不是資料庫...），喜歡夏天跳到海裡，然後也喜歡玩玩資料。","bio_en":"Started to work on a database project called Taiwan Biodiversity Network at the Endemic Species Research Institute as an Associate Research Fellow since 2016.

WeThePeople in the United States or E-pétitions in France). \\n\\tIn 2015, following the aftermath of the Sunflower movement, Taiwan government launches a request platform called JOIN, that allows citizens to address the ministries of the Executive Yuan. Each request that gathers at least 5000 signatures, get a written response from the government. In 2017, the implementation of the Participation Officer network (PO network) -public servants from each ministries- pushed the request system based on JOIN further, as selected requests are discussed through a two-month process gathering public servants, the petitioner, signatories and civil society organizations.\\n\\tWhat can we learn from this online-offline petition system? This talk (based on a one year and half fieldwork) draws from the sociology of controversies, to analyze the petition apparatus through requests content, PO’s interactions and meetings among actors. What do people ask to the government in Taiwan? How requests are handled by the administration and debated during meetings? What can and can\'t be discussed through this process?\\n\\tThe JOIN–PO network system is a place were established norms (laws, policies) are challenged. Through requests, people share expectations on how the government should work, about its role in society. JOIN and POs’ meetings are spaces were actors debate and redefine together what is just and unjust, what should be and not be. If citizens tend to underline what they consider to be malfunctions, they also tend to define what is for them a “good government”. Request and POs’ meetings are also moments were actors redefine the relation between the government and the society. \\n\\tFrom requests pushing in favor or against LGBT rights, from public servants’ requests pushing for changes in their profession to requests asking for corporal punishment, Taiwan petition system gives us an interesting overview of Taiwan society controversies. If we can learn a lot about what opposes people (agonistic pluralism), it also tends to show what brings them together.","summary_en":"","oral_language":"English","oral_languate_other":"","format":"演講 （20 分鐘）Talk (20 min)","topic":"海海人聲 Voice of the islanders","three_keywords":"JOIN, PO network, petition","cover_image":"https://i.imgur.com/hPqQCsAh.jpg","is_content_cc40":true,"is_presentation_cc40":true,"is_slide_cc40":true,"speakers":[{"display_name":"Fiorella Bourgeois","organization":"EHESS (School of Advanced Studies in Social Sciences)","avatar_url":"https://i.imgur.com/a5xI0guh.jpg","city":"Paris","info_url":"https://fiorellabgs.github.io/hackurious/about.html","bio":"EHESS (法国社會科學高等研究院) 政治社會學博士生.","bio_en":"Phd candidate in political sociology at the EHESS (École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales)."}],"verified":true,"createdAt":"2020-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","timeSheet":{"id":"5ef8c370ba206b030d66a386","議程日期":"2020-12-05","議程預設標題-華語":"Addressing the State : an analysis of the online-offline petition system in Taiwan","議程開始時間":"2020-12-05TInvalid date","議程長度":null,"分類主題-華語":"","分類主題-en":"","議程場地-華語":"成功大學綠色魔法學校 - 崇華廳","議程場地-en":"The Magic School of Green Technologies - 崇華廳"}},"5ef947a8ba206b030d66a392":{"id":"5ef947a8ba206b030d66a392","title":"資料與應用，從地方政府談公私協力是轉機還是困境","title_en":"","summary":"如果問到民間社群對政府開放資料的看法，不夠，不好，不行，不對，政府到底懂不懂什麼叫開放資料？從政府的角色談開放資料，誰要為資料正確負責，不對怎麼辦？為什麼選這個開放？政府跟民間在資料與應用總是充滿了衝突，民間總覺得政府學不會，但政府也不知道該怎麼講清楚。從口罩地圖看到了政府與民間每一個人都可以幫忙，但總是缺了點什麼？我們能讓這種協力文化走得更深更遠嗎？","summary_en":"","oral_language":"華語","oral_languate_other":"","format":"演講 （20 分鐘）Talk (20 min)","topic":"大島開放 Open island","three_keywords":"opendata, 政府, 協力","cover_image":"","is_content_cc40":true,"is_presentation_cc40":true,"is_slide_cc40":true,"speakers":[{"display_name":"林怡壯","organization":"臺南市政府智慧發展中心","avatar_url":"https://i.imgur.com/bvy2RsDh.jpg","city":"臺南市","info_url":"https://sdc-rdec.tainan.gov.tw/cp.aspx?n=13539","bio":"臺南市政府智慧發展中心主任，從傳統資通訊議題的經營管理一路走來，看見了現今資訊單位多元角色的發展，歷經社群經營，Maker Space與開放政府的發展與投入，一直到近幾年智慧城市的演進從未缺席，也期望之後能夠持續跟上科技發展腳步","bio_en":""}],"verified":true,"createdAt":"2020-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","updatedAt":"2020-08-23T00:00:00.000Z","timeSheet":{"id":"5ef947a8ba206b030d66a392","議程日期":"2020-12-04","議程預設標題-華語":"資料與應用，從地方政府談公私協力是轉機還是困境","議程開始時間":"2020-12-04TInvalid date","議程長度":null,"分類主題-華語":"","分類主題-en":"","議程場地-華語":"好想工作室","議程場地-en":"Good-Ideas Studio"}},"5ef99ae9ba206b030d66a39d":{"id":"5ef99ae9ba206b030d66a39d","title":"台灣政商人物資料庫，從點到線的資料協作","title_en":"","summary":"2018 年 g0v summit，來自馬來西亞的 sweemeng 分享了 Sinar Project，一個馬來西亞政治人物資料庫的實作。最近，我們嘗試使用 Sinar project 的原始碼來建立台灣自己的政商人物資料庫，但是仔細研究了原始碼，發現雖然有網站的程式碼，但是卻沒有後端資料的串接部分。於是我們想要重新打造一個用來建立台灣政商人物資料庫的系統。\\n於是我們利用開放原始碼的內容管理工具—Keystone.js 製作了一個資料庫管理介面，接下來我們將會使用 google spreadsheet 或其他類似的工具，提供給一般使用者也可以進行資料的協作，並且讓 spreadsheet 可以跟資料庫進行資料的同步。有了同步功能之後，便可以進行協作，讓所有人可以將相關資料利用這些工具加強資料庫的完整性。","summary_en":"","oral_language":"華語","oral_languate_other":"","format":"演講 （20 分鐘）Talk (20 min)","topic":"大島開放 Open island","three_keywords":"開放政治，開放資料，政商關係","cover_image":"","is_content_cc40":true,"is_presentation_cc40":true,"is_slide_cc40":true,"related_url":"https://github.com/readr-media/open-relationship","speakers":[{"display_name":"H.C.
